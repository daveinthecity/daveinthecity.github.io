## What can your team do in 10-mins every day?

Stand Ups are a big part of AGILE teams. Without speaking to each other everyday, people very quickly lose track of what's going on. Teams fail when people disconnect or activities are not coordianted.

Here are some great ways to avoid chaos and silos in teams:

### Wins + Blockers

Keep Stand Ups simple. Don't try to cover everything. Going around in a circle to everyone eats up all the time. 

Try focusing on 2 key things:

1. `Wins` - what did you finish yesterday
2. `Blockers` - what's stopping you moving forward today

  - Strictly `no updates` during standup - playbacks and retros are where you share lessons learnt.
  - Report what's DONE - give your team an energy boost.
  - Call for help - if you're stuck others can help (or it will hurt others if you don't coordiante).
  - Safe Zone - good teams can talk about what works and doesn't. Build [trust and empathy in teams](NoIdiotsAllowed.md).

### Who's the 'SCRIBE' and who's the 'SCRUM Master' today?

Be clear about who does what right at the start of Stand Up. Out Stand Ups always have 2 key players:

1. SCRUM Master leads Stand Up 

  - SCRUM Masters call time - long debates need to go offline.
  - Priorities are needed, every needs to be heard - leader ensure balance between 'everyone-is-heard vs priorities'.
  - When there's a fire to put out - keep distractions out. Team must socus on solving blockers in the critical path.

2. Scribes do KanBan real-time

  - SCRIBE must be ready - KanBan open and 'ready-to-type' before Stand Up starts.
  - Write it down in the room - get ideas, notes immediately into User Stories right there in the room.
  - Don't break the flow - listen hard, capture it first time right (try not to stop meeting rhythm to ask 'pls repeat that', but do it if you must).
  
### AGILE Discipline

Set team rules about acceptable / not acceptable behaviour.

  - Stand Ups starts in 3 mins - no exceptions / on the dot / even when somone is not around
  - 

### 10 mins is a lot of time

You can do a lot of things in 10 (focused) mins. Teams that can do a lot in 10 mins really change the world.

When we applied these 3 simple things in our team, everything changed. We got closer together. People stepped up to own  problems. 

No one was alone - others jumped in to help fix problems. Wins made us smile / Blockers made us cry (everyone together).

Starting is tough - our first team stand ups took 40 mins+. But we persisted, now Stand Ups are 10-12 mins everyday!
