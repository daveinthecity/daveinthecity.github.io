## What can your team do in 10-mins every day?

Stand Ups are a big part of AGILE teams. Without speaking to each other everyday, people very quickly lose track of what's going on. Teams fail when people disconnect or activities are uncoordianted.

Here are some great ways to avoid chaos and silos in teams:

### Wins + Blockers

Keep Stand Ups simple. Don't try to cover everything. Going around in a circle to everyone eats up all the time. 

Try focusing on 2 key things:

1. `Wins` - what did you finish yesterday
2. `Blockers` - what's stopping you moving forward today

Strictly `no updates` during standup. Being disciplined to report on what's DONE gives an energy boost. If you're stuck at something chances are it sill hurt someone else or others can help you out. Being able to talk transparently about what's working and doesn't work builds [trust and empathy in teams](NoIdiotsAllowed.md).

### Who's the 'SCRIBE' and who's the 'SCRUM Master' today?

Be clear about who does what right at the start of Stand Up. Out Stand Ups always have 2 key players:

1. SCRUM Master leads Stand Up 

  - [ ] SCRUM Masters call time on long debates that need to be taken offline
  - [ ] Priorities need to be set, it helps if a leader ensures everyone is heard / topics are prioritised
  - [ ] When there's a fire to put out - keep distractions out and the team focused on solving blockers in the critical path

2. Scribes do KanBan real-time

  - [ ] the SCRIBE must have the KanBan open and ready to type before Stand Up starts

### AGILE Discipline

Set team rules about acceptable / not acceptable behaviour.

  - [ ] all Stand Ups start 3 mins past. No exceptions.

### 10 mins is a lot of time

When we applied this AGILE discipline in our teams, everything changed. We got closer together. People stepped up to own problems and helps each other fix problems. 

Starting is tough - our first team stand ups took 40 mins+. But with persistence, now our Stand Ups are 10-12 mins. All without skipping a beat or lose out on something.
