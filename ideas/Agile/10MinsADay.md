## What can your team do in 10-mins every day?

Stand Ups are a big part of AGILE teams. Without speaking to each other everyday, people very quickly lose track of what's going on. Teams fail when people disconnect or activities are uncoordianted.

Here are some great ways to avoid chaos and silos in teams:

### Wins + Blockers

Keep Stand Ups simple. Don't try to cover everything. Going around in a circle to everyone eats up all the time. 

Try focusing on 2 key things:

1. `Wins` - what did you finish yesterday
2. `Blockers` - what's stopping you moving forward today

Strictly `no updates` during standup. Being disciplined to report on what's DONE gives an energy boost. If you're stuck at something chances are it sill hurt someone else or others can help you out. Being able to talk transparently about what's working and doesn't work builds [trust and empathy in teams](NoIdiotsAllowed.md).

### Who's the 'SCRIBE' and who's the 'SCRUM Master' today?

Be clear about who does what right at the start of Stand Up. Out Stand Ups always have 2 key players:

1. SCRUM Master leads Stand Up 

  - SCRUM Masters call time - long debates need to be taken offline
  - Priorities are needed, every needs to be heard - leader ensure balance between 'everyone-is-heard vs priorities'
  - When there's a fire to put out - keep distractions out. Team must socus on solving blockers in the critical path

2. Scribes do KanBan real-time

  - SCRIBE must be ready - KanBan open and 'ready-to-type' before Stand Up starts

### AGILE Discipline

Set team rules about acceptable / not acceptable behaviour.

  - Stand Ups start in 3 mins. On the dot. No exceptions.

### 10 mins is a lot of time

You can do a lot of things in 10 (focused) mins. Teams that can do a lot in 10 mins really change the world.

When we applied these 3 simple things in our team, everything changed. We got closer together. People stepped up to own  problems. 

No one was alone - others jumped in to help fix problems. Wins made us smile / Blockers made us cry (everyone together).

Starting is tough - our first team stand ups took 40 mins+. But we persisted, now Stand Ups are 10-12 mins everyday!
